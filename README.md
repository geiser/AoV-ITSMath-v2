## NULL Hypotheses

- **H1(null)**: Students who participated in the two control groups - scenarios without ITS and without training (**Ctrl.A**) , and scenarios without ITS but with training (**Ctrl.B**) - have the same math ability in both the pre-test and post-test (link:: [H1-H3-irt.em.norm.md](results/H1-H3-irt.em.norm.md)).


- **H2(null)**: Students who participated in scenarios with our ITS and training (**Exp**) have the same math ability in both the pre-test and post-test (link:: [H1-H3-irt.em.norm.md](results/H1-H3-irt.em.norm.md)).


- **H3(null)**: Students who participated in scenarios with our proposed ITS and with training (**Exp**) have the same learning gain that students who participated in control groups (**Ctrl.A** - without training and without ITS & **Ctrl.B** - with training but without ITS) (link:: [H1-H3-irt.em.norm.md](results/H1-H3-irt.em.norm.md)).


- **H4(null)**: Students "*who have something to learn*" (*students who do not obtain maximum scores on the pre-test and post-test*) and who participated in scenarios with our proposed ITS and with training (Exp) have the same learning gain that students who participated in control groups (**Ctrl.A** - without training and without ITS & **Ctrl.B** - with training but without ITS) (link:: [H4-irt.em.norm.md](results/H4-irt.em.norm.md)).
